Project Overview: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification
In this project, we will explore the classification capabilities of Support Vector Machines (SVM) using various tools and libraries.

Section 1: Designing and Testing Binary Classification Problems
Designing Binary Classification Problems:

Generate Synthetic Data: Create several binary classification problems with varying complexity. For example, generate between 100 to 1000 points in a two-dimensional space, assigning some points to class 1 and others to class -1.
Plot the Data: Plot the generated points in a two-dimensional graph. Utilize functions to generate data so that you can create and test points with distinct features and shapes automatically.
Classify Using SVM:

Apply SVM: Use SVM to classify the synthetic data. Start with a linear kernel and then experiment with different kernel types (e.g., RBF, polynomial) and their parameters.
Plot Decision Boundaries: Plot the decision boundary found by the SVM along with the training points. Also, plot the margin lines if possible. Most libraries provide functions to facilitate this.
Impact of Data Complexity:

Analyze Impact: Investigate how increasing the complexity of the data (e.g., more points or nonlinear data) affects kernel selection and the choice of kernel parameters. Reflect on which parameters work best for different kernels and why.
Section 2: Classification Using USPS Dataset
Use USPS Dataset:

Classify with SVM: Classify the USPS dataset (or a similar dataset used in a neural network project) using SVM.
Kernel and Parameters: Determine which kernel and parameters yield the best results.
Comparison with Neural Networks:

Compare Accuracy: Compare the classification accuracy of SVM with that of a neural network. Analyze which method performs better and provide reasons for the observed results.
Section 3: Classification of Image Data
Choose a Dataset:

Select Data: Choose an image dataset, preferably a binary classification dataset (e.g., images of cats and flowers). You can search for suitable datasets on sites like Kaggle.
Prepare the Data:

Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Image Preprocessing: Convert images to grayscale if they are in RGB format. Transform each image into a matrix of pixel intensities, then flatten this matrix into a one-dimensional vector to use as input to the SVM. Optionally, normalize the vectors before feeding them to the SVM.
Classify with SVM:

Training and Evaluation: Train the SVM model on the training set and evaluate its classification accuracy on the test set. Identify the best kernel and parameters based on performance.
General Guidelines:
Cross Validation: Use Cross Validation to avoid overfitting and ensure a robust model.
Accuracy Comparison: Compare the model's performance on training and test sets separately.
Data Normalization: Normalize data before inputting it to SVM to improve model performance.
